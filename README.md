# Power BI Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize HR data to uncover meaningful business insights. The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor employee distribution, attrition, tenure, and workforce diversity across various categories.

It showcases the end-to-end workflow: from data cleaning and transformation to modeling, DAX measures, and creating an interactive, insightful dashboard.

##  Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to turn raw HR data into a professional and interactive Power BI dashboard that can support decision-making within an organization. Key questions the dashboard answers include:

- What is the total headcount?
- How are employees distributed across gender, region, and education level?
- What is the attrition rate?
- What is the average tenure of employees?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** ‚Äì For data modeling, DAX calculations, and building the dashboard.
- **Power Query** ‚Äì For data transformation and cleaning.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Äì For creating measures and calculated columns.
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì Used as the source for HR data.

##  Workflow Overview

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Cleaned and formatted raw Excel data in Power Query.
- Removed blank or inconsistent rows.
- Renamed columns for clarity and standardization.

### 2. **Data Modeling**
- Created a star schema with:
  - One fact table (Employee data)
  - Multiple dimension tables (Departments, Regions, Date table)
- Defined relationships to enable filtering and drill-down analysis.

### 3. **DAX Calculations**
Created several key metrics, including:
- **Total Headcount**
- **Attrition Rate**
- **Average Tenure**
- **% by Gender, Region, Education**
- Custom calculated columns for tenure bands and age groups.

### 4. **Dashboard Design**
- Added cards for KPIs (headcount, attrition, tenure).
- Used bar, pie, and column charts for categorical breakdowns.
- Slicers for interactive filtering (e.g., gender, department, region).
- Drill-through pages for department-level analysis.
- Consistent color scheme and layout for clarity.
